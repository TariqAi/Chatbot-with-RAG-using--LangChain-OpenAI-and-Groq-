in this project , I have build a chatbot using Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) from scratch. I am used OpenAI's gpt-3.5-turbo LLM, which Iwill implement through LangChain's ChatOpenAI class. Furthermore, I used OpenAI's text-embedding-3-small for embedding and the Qdrant vector database as our knowledge base.
